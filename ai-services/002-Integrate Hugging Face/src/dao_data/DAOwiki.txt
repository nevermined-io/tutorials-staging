Decentralized Biotech / Biopharma 

A Guide to Decentralized Biotech 
By Jocelynn Pearl, published in Future (a16z) 4-20-2022 

Perlara PBC
Led by Ethan Perlstein
Perlara employs consultants that write work plans and perform project management for the development of therapies for families and nonprofit foundations seeking cures for rare diseases. It is a distributed biotech in the sense that it employs scientists around the world to work together to build ‘cure roadmaps’ for identifying new treatments for patients and foundations. 

Vibe Bio 
Led by Joshua Forman and Alok Tayi 
Vibe hopes to bring power and agency to patient communities by building out a DAO toolbox of sorts so that a given patient community could organize via a DAO, co-own and co-develop therapeutics to treat the illness they are suffering from. (Please note that this is Jocelynn’s ‘take’ and could be misleading, company is under development)

Molecule 
Led by Tyler Golato & Paul Kohlhaas 
Molecule was inspired by the open science movement and open drug development that was happening in certain patient communities. The idea was to utilize blockchain tools to help advance and fund early stage drug development. To that end, the company has made several savvy decisions that have advanced the DeSci space, including ideating IP-NFTs, NFTs tied to intellectual property (think, a drug or research-based IP), and launching the VitaDAO community to fund longevity research. They continue to seed new DAOs and help advance the funding of early stage drug development. Their marketplace currently boasts around 60 research projects available for funding.

BioDAO
BioDAO aims to be a collective funding DAO for biotech startups and drug discovery. Led by Rushi Trivedi and Alex Pustov. 
Discord community is still somewhat small. Project has been going on for 7+ months and the team has chosen to build mostly with core team and not community involvement. Similar to Molecule, the goal is to own biotech assets developed by DAO-funded projects.

Phage Directory
Learn more about Phage Directory in this UltraRare Podcast episode with the founders: https://rss.com/podcasts/ultrarare/452751/ 
Led by Jessica Sacher and Jan Zheng. Phage Directory was started from the observation that clinicians and scientists were seeking cures to antibiotic-resistant infections. Phage Directory was formed with a simple solution: building out a more concrete network of the people who might have the tools to help (in this case, phages). To date, the group has helped with three different cures. They continue to grow. Great model and simple template for decentralized cure discovery. 



Recerca - Tokenizing Research 
Led by David Hunt, Dr. Sean Young, & Tyler Ruben. Recerca first got momentum after the team won 2nd prize in the Hedera X Filecoin Grant, for an application centered around solving data integrity problems, crowdfunding research, and NFT based participant rewards. So far the team has made great strides with its premier study completed in November 2021, and the user facing application that distributes participant NFT rewards is currently in closed alpha.


Crowd Funded Cures
Could a pay-for-success model bring certain off-patent treatments and repurposed generic drugs to the forefront and into patient hands without patents?

ArtBlocks “Gels” 
By Jason Brown & Shawn Douglas. Gels is a science-inspired generative piece. Our algorithm simulates gel electrophoresis. The DNA band patterns in this work derive from combinations of a simulated experimental data and real-world data, including DNA sequences that encode several variants of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and the corresponding mRNA vaccines. Our algorithm first generates plausible sample tubes that typically contain one or more DNA fragments. Then, each sample is distributed and "run" on a simulated gel to create the characteristic band patterns that might be observed on real gels. Our simulations also take into account human error — mistakes are common in the lab.
